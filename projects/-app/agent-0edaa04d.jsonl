I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see you're working in a git repository at `/app` with some uncommitted changes. I'm here in **READ-ONLY** mode, which means I can:\n\n✓ Explore and read files in your codebase\n✓ Search for patterns using Glob, Grep, and Read\n✓ Run read-only bash commands (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n✓ Design detailed implementation plans\n✓ Identify critical files for implementation\n\n✗ I cannot create, modify, delete, or move any files\n✗ I cannot run commands that change system state\n\nI notice you have:\n- Modified `.claude.json` files\n- Some shell snapshots and todos directories\n- A clean git history with recent commits\n\nWhat would you like me to help you design or explore today? Please share your requirements, and I'll thoroughly analyze the codebase to create a detailed implementation plan for you.","thinking":"","signature":"","data":"","id":"","name":"","tool_use_id":"","content":null}],"usage":{"input_tokens":1072,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1069,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":228}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"9d6e127d-bc0f-410f-8edb-1deb7b926551","timestamp":"2025-12-10T14:28:26.563Z"}
